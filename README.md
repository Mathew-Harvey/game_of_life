## Description 🧐
One of the most interesting uses of compute today is modelling natural processes, eventally creating artifical intelligence This is a celluar Automaton invented by John Conway's "Game of Life". While the Game of Life has become something of a computational cliché, it is still important to build it from scratch as its core principles are tied directly to a core goal—simulating the natural world with code. The basic idea is to start with a simple configuration of counters (organisms), one to a cell, then observe how it changes as you apply Conway's "genetic laws" for births, deaths, and survivals.
## Motivation 🚀
As a biologist and student of coding and computer science, I wanted to learn about modeling natural process, building complex patterns from simple rule sets. I also used this project to learn about using the P5 node js package.
